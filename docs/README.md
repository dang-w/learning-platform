### 🧪 Testing `/testing`
- [**COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PLAN.md**](./testing/COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PLAN.md) - Complete testing strategy ✅
- [**TESTING_GUIDE.md**](./testing/TESTING_GUIDE.md) - How to run tests and contribute to testing ✅
- [**e2e-testing-fixes.md**](./testing/e2e-testing-fixes.md) - End-to-end testing fixes and workarounds ✅
- [**TEST_RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md**](./testing/TEST_RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md) - Template for reporting test results ✅

### 🚀 Development `/development`
- [**DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md**](./development/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) - Current project status ✅
- [**FINDINGS.md**](./development/FINDINGS.md) - Research findings and development insights ✅
