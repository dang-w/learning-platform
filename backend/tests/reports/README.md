# Test Reports

This directory contains standardized reports from the backend test suite. The structure follows the same pattern as the frontend testing reports for consistency.

## Directory Structure

- `html/`: Contains HTML test reports generated by pytest-html
- `junit/`: Contains JUnit XML reports for CI integration
- `coverage/`: Contains coverage reports generated by pytest-cov

## Generating Reports

### HTML Reports

```bash
# Generate HTML report
pytest --html=tests/reports/html/report.html
```

### JUnit XML Reports

```bash
# Generate JUnit XML report
pytest --junitxml=tests/reports/junit/report.xml
```

### Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html:tests/reports/coverage
```

## CI/CD Integration

These report directories are used in CI/CD pipelines for test result visualization and tracking.
