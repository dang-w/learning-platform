# Testing Plan and Current Status

## Current Testing Status

### Backend Tests

The backend testing structure is well-organized and follows best practices. The tests are located in the `backend/tests/` directory and use pytest for running tests.

Current backend test status:
- API endpoint tests: ✅ All passing
- Service layer tests: ✅ All passing
- Utility function tests: ✅ All passing
- Integration tests: ✅ All passing

### Frontend Unit Tests

Frontend unit tests are located in `frontend/src/__tests__/` and use Jest for testing components, hooks, and utilities.

Current frontend unit test status:
- Component tests: ⚠️ 76% passing (44/58 test suites)
- Hook tests: ⚠️ Partially failing, especially auth store-related tests
- Utility function tests: ✅ All passing

### E2E Tests

E2E tests use Cypress and are now consolidated in the `frontend/e2e-testing/` directory with a standardized structure for tests, reports, screenshots, and videos.

Current e2e test status:
- Authentication tests: ⚠️ 4/5 passing
- Dashboard tests: ✅ 9/9 passing
- Knowledge tests: ✅ 7/7 passing
- Learning path tests: ✅ 8/8 passing
- Resources tests: ✅ 4/4 passing API tests implemented
- Knowledge concepts tests: ✅ 4/4 passing API tests implemented
- Knowledge-spaced-repetition tests: ❌ 0/5 passing
- Profile tests: ⚠️ 5/10 passing

## Testing Plan

### 1. Backend Testing

**Regular Testing Schedule:**
- Run pytest for all backend tests before each commit
- Run integration tests before each PR
- Run coverage report weekly to ensure test coverage remains adequate

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create automated pre-commit hook for backend tests
- [ ] Set up weekly coverage reporting
- [ ] Ensure all new features have corresponding tests

### 2. Frontend Unit Testing

**Regular Testing Schedule:**
- Run Jest tests before each commit
- Run component tests before each PR
- Run coverage report weekly

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create automated pre-commit hook for frontend unit tests
- [ ] Set up weekly coverage reporting
- [ ] Ensure all new components have corresponding tests
- [ ] Fix remaining failing component tests (auth store, react-hook-form, API inconsistencies)

### 3. E2E Testing

**Current Issues:**
1. Knowledge-spaced-repetition tests are failing with authentication redirects
2. Profile tests are partially failing due to loading state and element visibility issues
3. Authentication for existing users has occasional failures
4. Configuration and task implementation issues in Cypress setup

**Regular Testing Schedule:**
- Run crucial paths (Authentication, Dashboard, Learning paths) daily
- Run full E2E test suite before each release
- Run resilient tests (with retries) for known flaky tests

**Action Items:**
- [x] ~~Consolidate E2E testing structure (per STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md)~~ Consolidate E2E testing structure
- [x] Standardize test reporting to a single format and location
- [x] Consolidate duplicate test configuration files
- [ ] Fix Knowledge-spaced-repetition authentication issues by implementing isolated test pages
- [ ] Address Profile tests loading state issues
- [ ] Improve authentication test reliability
- [ ] Set up daily automated E2E test runs for crucial paths
- [ ] Implement missing Cypress task definitions for authentication

### 4. Testing Infrastructure Improvements

- [x] Consolidate duplicate test configuration files to `frontend/e2e-testing/cypress.config.ts`
- [x] Standardize test reporting to `frontend/e2e-testing/reports/`
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for flaky tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Standardize authentication approach across all E2E tests

## Specific E2E Test Fixes

### Knowledge-Spaced-Repetition Tests (0/5 passing)

These tests are failing due to authentication redirect issues. Steps to fix:

1. Implement authentication bypass for test environment
2. Create isolated test pages like we did for resources
3. Add resilient waiting mechanisms for async operations
4. Improve error handling in the tests

Our approach will focus on implementing isolated test pages that provide a controlled environment for testing without authentication or real API dependencies.

**Testing Path:** `frontend/e2e-testing/cypress/e2e/knowledge-spaced-repetition.cy.ts`

### Profile Tests (5/10 passing)

The profile tests are partially failing due to loading state and element visibility issues. Steps to fix:

1. Implement consistent loading state handling
2. Add proper data-testid attributes to all profile components
3. Improve test resilience with better waiting mechanisms
4. Add specific error handling for profile-related operations

**Testing Path:** `frontend/e2e-testing/cypress/e2e/profile.cy.ts`

### Authentication Tests (4/5 passing)

One authentication test is failing occasionally. Steps to fix:

1. Identify the specific test case that's failing
2. Analyze the failure pattern
3. Implement more robust authentication handling in the test
4. Add retry mechanisms for auth-related operations

**Testing Path:** `frontend/e2e-testing/cypress/e2e/auth.cy.ts`

## Recent Testing Improvements

We've made significant progress in improving the testing infrastructure:

1. **Backend Tests**:
   - Fixed rate limiter tests
   - Resolved user profile endpoint issues
   - Fixed authentication test AsyncIO issues
   - All 138 backend tests now pass consistently

2. **Frontend Unit Tests**:
   - Fixed several component tests including Auth Login tests and Knowledge Page tests
   - Fixed ResourceForm tests by improving react-hook-form mocking
   - Identified remaining issues with API path inconsistencies and auth store implementation

3. **E2E Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Consolidated testing structure with a standardized approach
   - Improved testing documentation
   - Started implementing the isolated test page pattern for more reliable testing

## How to Run Tests

All testing commands are now standardized and refer to the consolidated testing structure. For detailed testing instructions, refer to the [Unified Testing Guide](docs/testing/UNIFIED_TESTING_GUIDE.md).
